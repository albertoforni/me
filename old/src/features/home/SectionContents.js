const aboutContent = `
Hi I’m Alberto a computer guy.
I’ve been working with javascript for 4 years (back-end and front-end),
in projects based on microservices, testing and continuos integration and delivery.

I went through a quite radical career change around 5 years ago,
going from being a charted accountant to a software developer.
When I realised that I didn’t want to be an accountant for the rest of my life,
I turned my passion for technology and programming into a full time job.
It’s one of the best choices I’ve ever done. Since than I proudly contributed
to 2 great startups at Solair (recently bought by Microsoft) and SafetyCulture
(in which Atlassian is one of the major investors) and now, I help ThoughtWorks
clients to understand their users needs and to build top quality software.
